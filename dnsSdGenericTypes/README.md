Standard DNS-SD Generic Service Types
=====================================

Definition of standard DNS-SD generic service types as constants.

DNS-SD generic service types are the first part of a DNS-SD service type, leaving out
the domain. An actual DNS-SD service type is composed as `<GENERIC TYPE>.<DNS DOMAIN>`.

The generic service type for standard services is standardized here.

The generic types are string outputs of this module.
